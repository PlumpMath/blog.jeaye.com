title: Signing Git commits with GPG
tags: [git, gpg, github, security]
---

Anyone can make a Git commit using any name and any email address. What prevents
someone from using my name and my email to contribute a malicious commit, or
even simply a commit no representative of me?

By default, nothing.

Git does, however, support signing commits and tags using a GPG key pair. Doing
so verifies that the commit was created by the owner of that key: you.
Furthermore, after sharing your public key with Github, your signed commits are
marked as `[verified]` for everyone to see. At that point, any commit made by
"you" which is unsigned should be considered untrusted.

### Setup
Assuming you have a GPG key pair generated already (if not, see
[here](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#INTRO)), you can begin signing
all of your commits with one Git setting change:

```bash
$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Each time you commit now, you'll be prompted for your GPG password. To be
prompted in the current terminal, there's one more setting you should change,
this time for GPG directly. In your `~/.bashrc` (or similar), add the following:

```bash
# Always prompt for GPG password from terminal
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```

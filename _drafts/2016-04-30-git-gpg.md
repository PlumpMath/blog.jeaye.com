title: Signing Git commits with GPG
tags: [git, gpg, github, security]
---

Anyone can make a Git commit using any name and any email address. What prevents
someone from using my name and my email to contribute a malicious commit, or
even simply a commit no representative of me?

By default, nothing.

Git does, however, support signing commits and tags using a GPG key pair. Doing
so verifies that the commit was created by the owner of that key: you.
Furthermore, after sharing your public key with Github, your signed commits are
marked as `[verified]` for everyone to see. At that point, any commit made by
"you" which is unsigned should be considered untrusted.

title: Signing Git commits with GPG
tags: [git, gpg, github, security]
---

Anyone can make a Git commit using any name and any email address. What prevents
someone from using my name and my email to contribute a malicious commit, or
even simply a commit no representative of me?

By default, nothing.

Git does, however, support signing commits and tags using a GPG key pair. Doing
so verifies that the commit was created by the owner of that key: you.
Furthermore, after sharing your public key with Github, your signed commits are
marked as `[verified]` for everyone to see. At that point, any commit made by
"you" which is unsigned should be considered untrusted.

### Setup
Assuming you have a GPG key pair generated already (if not, see
[here](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#INTRO)), you can begin signing
all of your commits with one Git setting change:

```bash
$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Each time you commit now, you'll be prompted for your GPG password. To be
prompted in the current terminal, as opposed to in a GUI popup, there's one more
setting you should change, this time for GPG directly. In your `~/.bashrc` (or
similar), add the following:

```bash
# Always prompt for GPG password from terminal
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```

When you commit, you'll be prompted with a TUI along the lines of:

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ key for the OpenPGP certificate:                   │

```

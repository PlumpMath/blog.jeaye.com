good:

easy install of steam/skype/etc
  dep management

upgrade a kernel with 1 line change

keep it all on github

grub allows selecting previous

can install from linux

bad:

bash becomes slow

firefox slow startup

awful documentation

can't just build software
  need nix expressions
  not good for developing C++ apps
  vim plugins don't work

to where does it install?

no startx
  need a DM
  default DM doesn't read .xinit
    is no longer active

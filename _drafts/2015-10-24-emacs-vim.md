title: Trying Emacs (evil mode) after 5 years of Vim
tags: [emacs, vim, review]

As I've covered in a [previous post](http://blog.jeaye.com/2015/08/23/vimb/), I'm a passionate Vim user; maybe a little obsessive at times. Setting my love for Vim aside, Emacs, being Vim's life-long nemesis, presents some interesting benefits. I took a week, this month, to use Emacs exclusively in my work (including C++14 and Common Lisp) in order to weigh its benefits. Here's what I found.


DESTDIR doesn't work properly, need --prefix

tabbing is shit (elscreen)
  can't move tabs
  huge and ugly
  creating always goes to the end
  can't easily create tabs from helm

coloring is bad
  C++ is awful

no support for common syntax (need a whole major mode)
  cmake
  markdown

mouse scrolling is jumpy

showing full file path as a buffer name
  uniquify doesn't do it

indentation rules per major mode
  can't just set it to work properly once

:e and :tabnew work relative to the current buffer

J in evil doesn't keep a space before the merged line

grepping in project doesn't seem to work well
  using projectile

readline chords like ^W don't work in evil mode

terminal coloring is fucked

obviously annoying key chords

evil doesn't provide :help

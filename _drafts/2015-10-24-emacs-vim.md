title: Trying Emacs (evil mode) after 5 years of Vim
tags: [emacs, vim, review]

As I've covered in a [previous post](http://blog.jeaye.com/2015/08/23/vimb/), I'm a passionate Vim user; maybe a little obsessive at times. Setting my love for Vim aside, Emacs, being Vim's life-long nemesis, presents some interesting benefits. I took a week, this month, to use Emacs exclusively in my work (including C++14 and Common Lisp) in order to weigh its benefits. Here's what I found.

I would never consider trying Emacs if it didn't have [Evil mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil). I love Vim's modal editing and text object navigations too much. However, once I heard from multiple trusted sources that Emacs' Evil mode is the real deal, Emacs became a more viable option. If I bring Vim to Emacs, I wondered, would there be a net gain? Can Emacs reach parity with Vim and provide a platform for exceeding my current productivity?

My resulting, very cleanly organized, Emacs configs are available [here](https://github.com/jeaye/emacs-dotfiles) and I'll be referencing sections of them later.

### Compiling
I run a custom/minimal Slackware 14.1 x86_64 built from source. Slackware 14.1 officially ships Emacs 24.3, but I like to run the latest editors and I also like judge build systems, so I build Emacs 24.5.1 from source.

Emacs uses a standard Automake build, so the typical commands will do the trick:

```bash
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ ../configure && make -j8 && make install
```

However, I install my locally-built software to `~/opt`, and I expect software to use `DESTDIR` properly. Emacs doesn't. As a result, `--prefix` needs to be set during configuration.

```bash
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ ../configure --prefix=/home/jeaye/opt/bin/emacs-24.5
$ make -j8 && make install
```

### Reaching parity with Vim
Once I had emacs installed, I wanted to jump right into getting it up to speed with my Vim muscle memory. Again, I wasn't looking to re-learn how to edit text, I was seeing if Emacs could provide all I want and use from Vim *and more*. Let's take this in sections.

#### Packaging
To install packages in Emacs, I *highly* recommend [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package). You can see, from my configs, just how expressive it is. Combined with lazy loading, it can not only clean up your configs, but also decrease your load times.

#### Evil mode
I'll be honest, Evil mode is superb. The gripes I do have with it are minimal and, in general, it behaves just as I'd expect.

tabbing is shit (elscreen)
  can't move tabs
  huge and ugly
  creating always goes to the end
  can't easily create tabs from helm

coloring is bad
  C++ is awful

no support for common syntax (need a whole major mode)
  cmake
  markdown

mouse scrolling is jumpy

showing full file path as a buffer name
  uniquify doesn't do it

indentation rules per major mode
  can't just set it to work properly once

:e and :tabnew work relative to the current buffer

J in evil doesn't keep a space before the merged line

grepping in project doesn't seem to work well
  using projectile

readline chords like ^W don't work in evil mode

terminal coloring is fucked

obviously annoying key chords

evil doesn't provide :help

Finding a reasonably-priced apartment in the Bay Area can be a stressful job.
After factoring in the pressure of an expiring lease, making a poor decision can
be even easier. One approach to weeding out the influx of duplicated, spammy,
and unwanted postings is to use a bot and a set of filters. Such a bot could
crawl various apartment listing sites, match all listings against your filters,
and report to you in whichever format you prefer: email, HipChat, IRC, RSS, etc.
Such a bot may look something like this.

Talk about:
  existing bots (python, didn't work)
  law for infinite set (ignore first third to get price)

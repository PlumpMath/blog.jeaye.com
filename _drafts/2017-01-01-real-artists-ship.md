title: Real artists ship

I want to tackle an issue which seems prevalent in the modern software
engineering industry. The idea, laid down by [Steve Jobs](TODO), is that "real
artists ship" and everyone else is forgotten. What does it mean to be a "real
artist," and what does it mean to "ship" as one? I think what Jobs meant when he
said it and what many others mean when they parrot it may be quite different.
It's become a facade, analogous to
[YOLO](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yolo), intended to cover
one's tracks of poor engineering practices, lack of tool understanding, and lack
of concern for the success of the product beyond delivery.

### It's a joke

### The philosophy

### The damage

### What Jobs really meant

### What "real artists" may be

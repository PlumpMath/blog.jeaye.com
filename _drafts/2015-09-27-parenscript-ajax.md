When looking to make full-stack web applications in lisp, Common Lisp and Parenscript are just as capable as Clojure and Clojurescript, if only less documented. While looking to make a web-based REPL for [jank](TODO), my statically-typed functional programming language, I evaluated both the Clojure and Common Lisp stacks and, ultimately, decided on Common Lisp.

title: The deal with C++14 xvalues
tags: [c++, cpp, xvalue, rvalue, lvalue, value-category]
---

I recently published a [C++14 value category
cheat-sheet](https://github.com/jeaye/value-category-cheatsheet/blob/master/value-category-cheatsheet.pdf),
which was created to accompany a tech talk I gave at work. For the most part, examples on
prvalues and lvalues were understood with minimal confusion. However, xvalues
presented the biggest hurdle for existing C++ programmers. I'd like to explore,
in greater detail, why C++11 introduced xvalues and how they are essential to
efficient programming in modern C++.

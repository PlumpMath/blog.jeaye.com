title: From vim-gtk to vim-qt

[vim-qt](https://bitbucket.org/equalsraf/vim-qt/wiki/Home) is a gvim replacement
which aims to address a number of graphical issues in the standard gtk-based
vim. After having used the default gvim for years, and putting up a number of
its quirks, I decided to give vim-qt a run for its money. In short, I was
pleasantly surprised.

My most notable gripes with gvim are regarding its cell rendering. If the
`guifont` setting doesn't perfectly match the width of the window, in that
`(window_width % character_with) == 0`, there is some remaining space which is
left uncolored. Depending on your font size and window width, that can be almost
a full character's width. To remedy this, one will need to influence the gtk
renderer using external configs; I haven't had much luck with it.

Aside from that, gvim's actual GUI elements aren't configurable. Sure, you can
`:set guiopts-=m` to remove the menu, but you can't change the size, color,
 and font of the tabs. You also have no control over where the tool bars render.

Note that each issue described here is also present in vim-gnome and other vim
GUIs based on vim-gtk.

-- qvim width is correct
-- qvim tabs
-- qvim configuration

-- doesn't have a man page
-- not sure how active (lots of long-standing bugs)
-- irc channel

[vim-qt](https://bitbucket.org/equalsraf/vim-qt/wiki/Home) is a gvim replacement
which aims to address a number of graphical issues in the standard gtk-based
vim. After having used the default gvim for years, and putting up a number of
its quirks, I decided to give vim-qt a run for its money. In short, I was
pleasantly surprised.

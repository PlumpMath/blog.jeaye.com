For the past decade, [Unity3D](http://madewith.unity.com/) has lacked official
Linux support. Some tenacious users have [worked around this with
WINE](https://github.com/Unity3D-Wine-Support/Unity3D-on-Wine), with varying
degrees of success. Fortunately for us Linux users, [Unity3D is now officially
available
](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/08/26/unity-comes-to-linux-experimental-build-now-available/) and support is provided in the new [Linux forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/). To improve the situation even more, [Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia) is also compatible with this new Linux build. I'll cover here how to get things up and running.
